                <div class="sub-title" id="sr5" #sr5>5. COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</div>
                <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and
                    pixels) to access or store information.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>A "cookie" is a small file of letters and numbers that is sent to your computer
                    by a website and automatically saved on your computer by your web browser
                    (e.g. "Internet Explorer"). Each time you request a page from the website, your
                    web browser sends this cookie back to the website server.</p>
                <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Staymaster Services Private
                    Limited) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the
                    website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third
                    party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g.
                    like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these
                    third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the
                    website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>
                <p>Some cookies used are necessary for the operation of the website (strictly
                    necessary), others for analysing the use of our services (we collect these data
                    through Google Analytics).</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>We use cookies to store your preferences, record session information,
                    maintain user specific information on what pages you access or visit on the
                    Site, alert you to new information that we think may be of interest to you when
                    you return to our Site, and customize web page content based on your browser
                    type or other information we collect.</p>
                <p></p>
                <div class="sub-title" #sr6>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</div>
                <p></p>
                <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for
                    the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is
                    required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal
                    requirements).</p>
                <p>Your personal data will be deleted if your last interaction with us (for example
                    your last visit to our property or opening marketing communication from
                    Staymaster) was over 5 years ago, unless legal obligations relating to financial
                    transactions require us to keep longer some personal data.</p>
                <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
                    information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is
                    not possible (for example, because your personal information has been st ored
                    in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and
                    isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
                <p></p>
                <div class="sub-title" #sr7>7. HOW WE SECURE YOUR INFORMATION?</div>
                <p></p>
                <p>When you place an order or make a booking on our Site, all of your order
                    information, including your credit card number and delivery address, is
                    transmitted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology
                    causes your browser to encrypt your information before transmitting it to our
                    secure server. SSL technology, an industry standard, is designed to prevent
                    someone other than operators of our websites from capturing and viewing
                    your personal information.</p>
                <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational
                    security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information
                    we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
                    information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
                    storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
                    promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
                    parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access,
                    steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your
                    personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our
                    Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a
                    secure environment.</p>
                <p></p>
                <div class="sub-title" #sr8>8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</div>
                <p></p>
                <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of
                    age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you
                    are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor
                    dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from
                    users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the
                    account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our
                    records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children
                    under age 18, please contact us at <a

                <div class="sub-title" #sr9>9. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS</div>
                <p></p>

                <p>In accordance with applicable laws, you may have rights in relation to your
                    personal information. Such rights include:</p>
                <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your
                    personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending
                    on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
                    You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the
                    contact details provided in the <span (click)="scroll(sr11)" class="bg-yellow">“How to Contact Us”</span> section below.
                </p>

                <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the p rocessing
                    before its withdrawal, nor when applicable law allows, will it affect the
                    processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful
                    processing grounds other than consent.</p>
                <p><strong>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</strong> You can
                    unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time
                    by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting
                    us using the details provided in the section "How to Contact Us" section below.
                    You will then be removed from the marketing lists — however, we may still
                    communicate with you, for example to send you service-related messages that
                    are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to res pond to
                    service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.</p>

                <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> Most Web browsers are set to accept
                    cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to
                    remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or
                    reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our services.</p>
                <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us
                    at info@thestaymaster.com.</p>

                <div class="sub-title">FEATURES</div>
                <p></p>
                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
                    applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate
                    to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
                    activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology
                    standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
                    such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
                    mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
                    online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
                    future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
                    privacy policy statement.</p>
